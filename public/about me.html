<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Serena Brito, I'm 24 years old and I'm from Portugal.</p>

<p>I studied "Visual Arts" in high school back in 2019, after that I started working in call centers to get some money, in 2022 I signed up in a Music School called "ACR Music&Voices", and I'm still there at the moment. On September 2023, I've become unemployed from call center, and eventually I took a course of "Social Media Management", and some "Music Production" Udemy courses. </p>

<p>Right now, I'm still unemployed and I decided to get a new skill that could help me get a better job, and I started learning "Web Development" with a Dr Angela Yu course.</p>
